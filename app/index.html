          <p class="text-block">I am currently a software developer at <a>Evident Point</a>, a small and unique startup-like company in <a>Richmond, BC</a>.  My focus is on creating purposeful interactive web applications; my current work on <a>Active Textbook</a> allows me to wear many hats -- one day I'll be knee-deep hammering out code, the next I'm writing detailed integration specs for a new cool feature, and another I'm meeting up and gathering requirements with prospective clients.  Most importantly, my work has a direct impact on helping students enrich their learning experiences, which ultimately makes it rewarding to come in to work every day.</p>


          <p class="text-block">In 2011, I received my Master of Science degree from the School of Computing Science at <a>Simon Fraser University</a>.  Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from the <a>Faculty of Mathematics</a> at the University of Waterloo.  My full 6 years in academia has resulted in a solid fundation in theoretical CS that I am now rounding-off with practical experience the <a><b>real world</b></a>.</p>  

          <p class="text-block">During my time as a graduate student, my research interests focused on human factors in computing, ranging from user-centered design, novel interaction techniques, and improving user experience on mobile devices. I conducted post-graduate research at the <a>SYNAR lab</a>, working on the Green Phones project led by <a>Dr. Arrvindh Shriraman</a> and <a>Dr. Brian Fraser</a>.  Our team focused on concisely understanding how energy is consumed on (then) modern Android-based smartphones and attempted to provide smart kernel-level optimizations for a phone’s various hardware components (e.g., the CPU, WiFi and 3G radios, etc.) in order to maximize battery life.</p>

          <p class="text-block">In my spare time, I enjoy attempting to <a>overcome gravity</a>, <a>tinkering with computer hardware to make them inaudible</a>, <a>messing around with DSLRs</a>, <a>listening to music through fancy headphones</a>, and playing the drums poorly.  I am also <b>crazy</b> about <a>anything</a> <a>related</a> <a>to</a> <b>hockey</b>, and, aside from that <a>one embarassing day</a> in June 2011, a proud supporter of the <a>Vancouver Canucks</a>.</p>

                      As part of my work on the Green Phones project, led by <a>Dr. Arrvindh Shriraman</a> and <a>Dr. Brian Fraser</a>, I was actively involved in developing both user and kernel-level applications for Android smartphones. The Green Phones project aimed to understand and concretely define factors that could influence overall power consumption in modern Android-based smartphones, with the ultimate goal of being able to provide strong power consumption estimates based on low-level usage statistics – such as instruction fetch misses or TLB cache misses – for any given application available on the Android Market.</p>
                    </p>

                    <p>The result of this work was intended to allow users to be mindful of applications that are unnecessarily power-hungry. We then utilized these gathered statistics to create smarter kernel-level optimization schemes custom tailored for specific mobile phones, and to also provide a set of guidelines for software developers to use in order to write more energy-efficient software.

                      I initially began work on the Green Phones project to fulfil course requirements for a <a>multicore architectures seminar</a>; through the completion of this work, I successfully developed several fine-grained user-level component stressors via a custom Android application, created an accurate and easy to use power measurement and gathering tool using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware components, and essentially assembled all the necessary tools and testbeds required to begin work on the next (unfinished) phases of the project which I continued work on as part of post-graduate research.

                      As my last course as a graduate student, I enrolled in an autonomous robotics seminar out of pure interest and a life-long fascination of robots.  The course focused on cutting edge technical research, covering behaviour-based robotics; several navigation and localization schemes utilizing nearness diagrams, vector fields, and dynamic windows; task coordination in multi-robot systems; and evolutionary robotics. The most notable takeaway from the course was the importance of <i>“keeping things simple”</i> – one does not necessarily need to come up with complex robotic controllers to achieve complex behaviour. Such an example is <a>stigmergy</a>, in which individuals in a multi-agent system communicate with one another indirectly using the environment to achieve a seemingly complex global solution, without using any planning or explicit coordination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For a semester-long project, I tackled the problem of energy-constrained foraging in tight environments. Using C++ and <a>Stage 4.0.1</a>, I built controllers for two types of robots — a large tanker robot which acted as a mobile storage container and refueling station, and several smaller helper robots which conducted the actual foraging. These controllers are robust due to their simplicity; while complex in their initial versions, the set of governing rules was refined in an iterative process until only a select few simple rules remained while still fulfilling environmental restrictions. The end result of my work is a system that is more effective, efficient, and robust than traditional single-robot foraging architectures.
